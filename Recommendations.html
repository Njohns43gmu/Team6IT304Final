        <p>There are two important aspects when it comes to mitigating the risks associated with deepfakes. These aspects are regulation as well as image editing. As this technology is fairly new, our legal system still has to catch up to it in order to protect individuals.</p>
        <p>There's a legal grey area when it comes to deepfakes and AI generated content as a whole. On one hand, one could say that the use of AI is a part of one's freedom of expression. However, many argue that AI generated content is inherently unoriginal as these models are often trained on exisisting artwork or videos. In many cases, this is done without the permission of the original owner of said media.</p>
        <h2>
            So what can we do to stop this?
        </h2>
        <h3>Regulation</h3>

        <p>Recently, multiple bills have been proposed regulating the use of deepfakes. These cases center around the 2024 election as there have been several cases of deepfakes being used.
            It's important for lawmakers to also consider how deepfakes can affect individuals privacy. We propose additional regulations which limit what these models are able to be trained on, as well as how this data can be used.
            The potential consequences of a deepfake can be severe.
        </p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>Another way to mitigate the risks of deepfakes would be through the implementation of detection software in websites, as well as watermarking media. Watermarks can be used to authenticate images posted on websites
            in order to determine whether or not it was AI generated. While not always effective, digital grain can be added to prevent AI models from being properly trained on that image.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>At this point in time, deepfakes are not going away. So, we need lawmakers to begin implementing regulations for the use of deepfakes in order to protect not just individuals, but our society as a whole.</p>
